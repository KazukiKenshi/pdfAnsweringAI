Have you ever wondered if your pdf could talk to you and respond to your questions and
queries? With this project you can create an AI that responds to your questions about the
pdf that is being viewed at the moment.

Your task at hand is to create a model that leverages natural language processing
techniques to provide quick and accurate responses from the context of the pdf that is
being viewed. You are free to use any methods within the constrictions of the project like
word2vec, glove embedding technique etc.., however, use of APIs is not allowed.

There are multiple ways to use your model and display it's working. You are free to use any
method. Following is some of the methods recommended to use:

- Create a google extension (brownie points)
- Using a simple upload pdf and question interface (recommended)
