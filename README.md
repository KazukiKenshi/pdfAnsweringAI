# Project Overview

This project utilizes a fine-tuned BERT model to answer questions based on content from a provided PDF file. The application includes a basic PDF reader that highlights the answers within the document.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3 should be installed on your system.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
   - Run the following command to install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Running the Application:**
   - After installing the dependencies, navigate to the app folder.
   - Execute the `app.py` script by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```

   This command will start the application, allowing you to interact with the PDF reader and the BERT-based question answering functionality.

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebooks

There are 2 Jupyter notebooks provided in this repository:

1. **Training Code Notebook:**
   - Contains the code used to train the BERT model.
   - Located in the `training_code.ipynb` file.

2. **Model Usage Notebook:**
   - Demonstrates how to use the trained model for question answering.
